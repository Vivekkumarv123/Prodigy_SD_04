**#Task_04: Sudoku Solver GUI with Tkinter**

This Python code implements a Sudoku solver with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

**Features:**

* Provides a 9x9 grid for entering Sudoku puzzle numbers.
* Includes a "Solve" button to solve the entered puzzle.
* Displays an error message if the puzzle has no solution.
* Highlights the solved puzzle on the grid.

**Breakdown:**

* `SudokuSolverGUI` class:
    * Initializes the GUI window and sets the title to "Sudoku Solver".
    * Creates a 9x9 grid of Entry widgets to represent the Sudoku board.
    * Defines a `solve` method that:
        * Extracts the user input from the grid entries.
        * Calls the `solve_sudoku` function to solve the puzzle (explained later).
        * Updates the grid with the solved solution (if found).
        * Displays a message box if no solution exists.
    * Defines a recursive `solve_sudoku` function that implements the backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
        * Checks for empty spaces in the board.
        * Tries placing numbers 1 to 9 in the empty space.
        * Checks if the placement is valid based on row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid constraints.
        * If a valid placement is found, it recursively calls itself to solve the remaining board.
        * If no valid placement is found, it backtracks and tries a different number.
    * Helper functions:
        * `find_empty_location`: Finds an empty cell on the board.
        * `is_valid_location`: Checks if placing a number in a cell is valid based on Sudoku rules.
        * `get_board`: Extracts the user input from the grid and converts it to a numerical representation of the board.
        * `update_grid`: Updates the grid entries with the solved solution.
* `main` function:
    * Creates the main Tkinter window.
    * Creates an instance of the `SudokuSolverGUI` class.
    * Starts the main event loop (`mainloop`) to run the GUI application. 

**Note:**

* The code includes an example Sudoku puzzle commented out. You can uncomment it and use the "Solve" button to see the solution displayed on the grid.

This Sudoku solver GUI provides a user-friendly way to solve Sudoku puzzles visually. You can further enhance it by:

* Implementing a mechanism to check for user input errors (invalid characters, duplicate numbers in a row/column/subgrid).
* Adding options to generate random Sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels.
* Highlighting invalid placements during user input to provide real-time feedback.
